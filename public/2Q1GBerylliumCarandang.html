       <h1>STUDYING TIPS FOR PISAY STUDENTS</h1>
       <h3> Many newcoming PSHS students often encounter stories from their fellow schoolmates from upper batches, who say that
        time-management is a very important thing in the life of a Pisay student. Yet, being time-productive is easier said
        than done, and many students at first struggle with accomplishing this. Thus, the goal of this webpage is to help
        students who still struggle to keep their attention and focus in order to be productive, by providing some PRACTICAL
        tips that I personally find useful myself. </h3>
