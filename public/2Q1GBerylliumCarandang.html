       <h1 id="top">STUDYING TIPS FOR PISAY STUDENTS</h1>
       <h3 id="top">     Many incoming PSHS students often encounter stories from their fellow schoolmates from upper batches, who say that
        time-management is a very important thing in the life of a Pisay student. Yet, being time-productive is easier said
        than done, and many students at first struggle with accomplishing this. Thus, the goal of this webpage is to help
        students who still struggle to keep their attention and focus in order to be productive, by providing some PRACTICAL
        tips that I personally find useful myself. </h3>

        <h2>USE PRACTICE EXERCISES</h2>

        <h4>SAMPLE ARCHERS PHYSICS REVIEWER</h4>

        <h3>
                Practice exercises are a great way to employ "retrivial practice", in which you try to remember information
            long after since you first read it. I personally use this method a lot especially in topics such as Math and
            Social Science, as a quick and easy way to study before a test. I find it best that you solve the problems
            purely mentally, as this will build a strong memory of the topics that you have read, and will also help you
            actually critically think and analyze the things that you memorize.
        </h3>

        <h3>
            Best Practice exercises:
        <h3>
        <ul>
            <li>ARCHERS' Reviewers</li>
            <li>Online Reviewers</li>
            <li>Reviewers made by ChatGPT (useful: you can ask for explanation, solution, etc.)</li>
        </ul>

        

        <h2>TAKE ADVANTAGE OF TO-DO LISTS</h2>

        <h3>
                To-do lists personally help me in organizing and prioritizing tasks, helping me manage my time very efficiently.
            Why so? I personally like when I have reference that I can rely on, on what tasks to do first, keeping track 
            of how much things I need to do, and helps manage my expectations for certain days. To-do can be useful in many ways. I make to-do lists 
            of all my requirements but I also plan agendas for certain days or for certain weeks through the use of to-do lists.
            I always update my to-do list after every school day, to enter requirements and tasks given to us on that certain day.
            It is very nice to keep track of tasks on your own, as you can always trust that the information you are relying on is
            accurate, instead of relying on the to-do lists of others which you may not know might be inaccurate. This gives 
            ease of mind knowing that you didn't miss any requirements.

                I personally write to-do list entries in the following format: "[task] due [month][date]]"

        <h2>USE POMODORO TIMER</h2>

        <h3>
                Pomodoro timers are personally something that I do not use. The reason why I included it in this tutorial
            was because based on what I heard, it is a very effecient way to manage low attention span caused by neurological
            disorders such as ADHD, by taking advantage of attention bursts, and giving frequent breaks to regain focus on
            a certain topic. Although, based on my experience using it before in elementary to study for exams, it was a
            very efficient way to keep focus and productivity to the max along with using audio and visual background to
            help you focus even further. I use websites such as:
